### Self Assessment
Throughout Southern New Hampshire University’s computer science program, I have gained valuable experience across a broad range of essential areas that are crucial for my career as a full-stack web developer. This includes skills in web design, UI/UX design, statistics for data analysis, object-oriented programming, data structures and algorithms, system analysis and design, client/server development, the software development lifecycle, AI, discrete mathematics, and linear algebra. Concurrently with my studies, I worked as a web developer in a professional setting, beginning as a novice freelance developer managing simple WordPress sites, and advancing to my current role as a senior web developer, where I build and manage Digital Experience platforms and MarTech integrations for an international corporation.

The combination of academic learning and professional application has shaped me into a skilled and well-rounded computer science professional. I have developed the ability to dissect complex business problems and map out technical solution roadmaps throughout the SDLC, making them accessible to stakeholders with varying levels of technical understanding. Several courses were particularly impactful in my journey. CS 255 System Analysis and Design taught me how to create professional-quality business requirements documents, technical diagrams, and client presentations. CS 465 Full Stack Development introduced me to the MEAN stack and guided me through building an application, from environment setup to frontend, backend, and security integration. CS 250 Software Development Lifecycle deepened my understanding of Scrum methodology, project management, SDLC phases, and the importance of cross-functional team cooperation and shared ownership. CS 360 Mobile Architecture and Programming provided insights into mobile app development and served as the foundation for my original artifact—the inventory management app. Lastly, CS 305 Software Security equipped me with the skills to conduct vulnerability assessments, focusing on critical areas such as input validation, API interactions, cryptography, error handling, package dependencies, and code quality.

The capstone project was a culmination of these skills, allowing me to migrate an Inventory Management System from an Android-based application to a full-stack MEAN application. This project required not only technical proficiency but also strategic thinking in system architecture, database management, and user experience design. By transitioning from a relational database to a document-based model with MongoDB, I enhanced the system's scalability and flexibility. The adoption of RESTful APIs further modernized the application’s architecture, ensuring alignment with current industry standards.

As I conclude this program and present my ePortfolio, I reflect on the significant growth and development I have experienced. The artifacts in this portfolio showcase my comprehensive expertise in software design, data management, and security, each contributing to a cohesive narrative of my journey as a computer science professional. I am confident that the skills, knowledge, and values I have developed will enable me to make a meaningful impact in any organization, ready to address complex challenges with innovative solutions.
